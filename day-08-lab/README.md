# Sentence Drawings

Implement a simplified version of this [sentence drawing](http://vallandingham.me/sentence_drawings/) project using HTML Canvas. 

Original design by [Stefanie Posavec](http://www.stefanieposavec.com/).

## Using pen and paper with __others__, write the pseudo-code for the project

Don't worry about the specific JavaScript implementation (that's the easy part)

Carefully consider:

- What __data gathering__ you need to do (and when)
- What __shape__ the data needs to be in for you to start drawing
 - (hint: think about drawing each *stroke* of a pen)
- How to __translate__ from your data to specific locations on the screen
- What logic/algorithm you need to impose to get the drawing to __render__
