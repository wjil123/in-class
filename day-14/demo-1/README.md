# Demo-1

This small project demonstrates the use of external libraries, importing and exporting functions, and the updating of an element's state. Make sure to run `npm install` in this folder to install necessary packages, then `npm start`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
