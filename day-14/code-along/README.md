# Code Along 

In this activity, you'll consider how to appropriately **lift up state** from child components by building a **searchable table**. Install necessary packages using `npm install`, then start running a local server by running `npm start`. Then, follow instructions in the `App.js` file to create your project. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
